### 3.Jami:
Impact on project:

Business strategist who turned just syntax and logic into designing Zynthax’s customer strategy and market positioning.  
Jami turned a hackathon project into full fleged startup with stratergy,market gap and need for Zynthax to this world.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.Aditya
Impact on project:

Architecture of Zynthax workflow system, workspace collaboration layer, immutable logging, and secure secret management.  
Aditya  connected the chaos into a system.Gave direction to the project.

## 2. Idea Proposal and Implementations

### Shubham:
- Instant webhook notifications when payments are received. Never miss a transaction.
- Connect MetaMask, Phantom, and other popular wallets seamlessly

### Utkarsh:
- Coined the name Zynthax, giving the product its identity before it even had a form.
- Explored countless color palettes and layout systems to shape how the platform feels, not just how it looks.
- Designed the Zynthax logo and engineered a color scheme optimized for attention and visual calm—so users can build complex nodes        without mental fatigue.

### Jami:
- Identified high value customer segments including DAOs and professional crypto traders, defining Zynthax’s initial market direction.
- Conducted market research on crypto activity and transaction scale to quantify Zynthax’s real-world business impact
- Explored funding pathways with blockchain ecosystems such as Solana to position Zynthax as a venture-backed startup, not just a hackathon project.

### Aditya:
- Pluggable connectors for Google Sheets, Discord, Slack, Telegram, and other services to orchestrate the full automation stack.
- Low-code visual workflow editor for building production-grade automation pipelines.

## 3. Technical Thinking and PR's made

### Shubham:
- Engineered multi-wallet support architecture with seamless connectivity across MetaMask, Phantom, and other major wallet providers.
- Implemented intelligent transaction routing and gas-fee optimization strategies to minimize cost while maximizing execution reliability.
- Built a real-time webhook notification system to deliver instant, event-driven alerts on incoming payments and on-chain activity.
- Integrated Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime) as the primary data layer, enabling secure, structured storage for workflows, wallet events, and audit logs.
- Designed the database schema for high write throughput and query-efficient indexing to support real-time transaction ingestion.
- Built the backend to be fault-tolerant and production-ready, with graceful degradation under peak load.
- Architected stateless API services behind a load-balancing layer to distribute traffic evenly and ensure horizontal scalability

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Utkarsh:
- Used Framer Motion to implement smooth, performant animations and micro-interactions that improve user feedback and flow.
- Designed the complete UI system in Figma, creating reusable templates and design tokens before translating them into production-ready components.
- Maintained clean, modular, and well-documented code, enforcing consistent styling, responsive layouts, and cross-browser compatibility.
- Optimized for performance, accessibility, and usability, ensuring the interface remains fast and intuitive even as workflows grow complex.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Jami:
- Engineered data pipelines and domain logic for spend analytics, provider validation, transaction logging, and deterministic workflow node outputs.
- Built the domain logic for spend computation, provider trust models, transaction persistence, and workflow-node output orchestration.
- Turned raw transactions into business intelligence—designing spend tracking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Aditya:
- Implemented a low-code, node-based visual workflow engine for composing production-grade automation pipelines with schema validation, sandboxed execution, and deterministic state handling.
- Enforced least privilege access, token rotation, and encrypted environment injection to ensure integrations remain safe even under partial system compromise.
- Built pluggable integration connectors for Google Sheets, Discord, Slack, Telegram, and other services using OAuth 2.0, scoped API tokens, and webhook-based event delivery to securely orchestrate the full automation stack.
